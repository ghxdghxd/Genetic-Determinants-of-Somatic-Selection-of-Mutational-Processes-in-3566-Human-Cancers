## Introduction

* This repository contains the necessary data and code to replicate the analysis and figures of **JT Guo *et al*,Genetic Determinants of the Somatic Selection of Mutational Processes in 3566 Human Cancers.**

* Scripts in this repository are written in **R**, **Python**, and **Julia**.

* The results here are based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network: <https://www.cancer.gov/tcga>.

* All the multiomics data can be download from UCSC Xena TCGA hub <https://tcga.xenahubs.net>, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia project (CCLE, <https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle>), The Cancer Dependency Map Project at Broad Institute (DepMap, v19q2; <https://depmap.org/portal/>) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer V8 (GDSC, <https://www.cancerrxgene.org/>).
